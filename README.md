## Introduction to Exception Handling

Exception handling is a programming construct that allows you to handle runtime errors and exceptional situations gracefully. It provides a mechanism to catch and deal with errors without crashing your program.

This repository covers the basics of exception handling in C++, including different types of exceptions and how to use them effectively.

## Types of Exceptions

There are two main types of exceptions in C++:

1. Standard Exceptions: These are built-in exceptions provided by C++ and are used to handle common errors.
2. User-Defined Exceptions: You can create your own custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios.

This repository explains both types and how to use them.

## Syntax for Exception Handling

In C++, exception handling is done using the `try`, `catch`, and `throw` blocks. The syntax for exception handling is straightforward:

```cpp
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}
